1. 范文一:

    1. 原文：  
        * *Six months ago the region of Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the region's highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change took effect, the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent. But the speed limit in Elmsford, a region neghboring Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined sloghtly during the same six-month period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what it was before the increase.*

    2. 论据：
        * Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles by ten miles per hour
        * the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent
        * the speed limit in Elmsford remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined slightly during the same six-month period
    
    3. 结论：
        * If the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what before the increase.
    
    4. 分析：
        * 论据1，2建立因果，可以攻击时序性因果错误，找出他因，削弱论据1，2间因果联系
        * 论据3和论据1，2之间是类比关系，错误类比
        * 是否忽略其他导致交通事故的原因，是否limit speed就减少交通事故
    
    5. 范文：
        * The argument is well-presented,but not thoroughly well-reasoned. By making a comparison of the region of Forestville, the town with the higher speed limit and therefore aitomobile accidents, with the region of Elmsford, an area of a lower speed limit and subsequently fewer accidents, the argumet for reducing Forestville's speed limits in order to decrease accidents seems logical.(用seem表不合理)
        
        * However, the citizens of Forestville are failing to consider other possible alternatives to the increasing car accidents after the raise in speed limit. Such alternatives may include the fact that there are less reliable cars traveling the roads in Forestville,(车况不同) or that the age bracket of theose in Elmsford may be more conducive to drving safely.(驾驶者本算因素). It is possible that there are more younger, inexperienced, or more elderly, unsafe drivers in Forestville than there are in Elmsford. In addition, the citizens have failed to consider the geographical and physical terrain of the two different areas.(道路状况不同) Perhaps Forestville's highway is in an area of more dangerous curves, sharp turns, or has many intersections or merging points where accidents are more likely to occur. It appears reasonable, therefore, for the citizens to focus on these trouble spots than to reduce the speed in the entire area. Elmsford may be an area of easier driving conditions where accidents are less likely to occur regardless of the speed limit.(先攻击类比问题)

        * A six-month period is not a paricular longtime frame for the citizens to determine that speed limit has influenced the number of automobile accidents in the area.(时间不够长也不能下结论，削弱因果) It is mentioned in the argument that Elmsford accidents decreased during the time period. This may have been a time, such as during harsh weather conditons,(驾驶情况) when less people were driving on the road and therefore the number of accidents decreased. However, Forestville citizens, perhaps coerced by employment or other requirements, were unable to avoid driving on the roads. Again, the demographics of the population are important.(人口基数问题) It is possible that Elmsford citizens do not have to travel fa from work or work from their home, or do not work at all. Are there more people in Forestville than there were six months ago? If so, there may be an increased number of accidents due to more automobiles on the road,(把人口和事故联系，削弱速度和事故联系) and not due to the increased speed limits. Also in reference to the activities of the population, it is possible that Forestville inhabitants were traveling during less safe times of the day,(驾驶时间) such as early in the morning, or during twilight. Work or family habits may have encouraged citizens to drive during this time when Elmsford residents may not have been forced to do so.(批驳忽略他因的错误，官方说明：identifying a central flaw in the argument and developing that critique extensively)

        * Overall, the reasoning behind decreasing Forestville's speed limit back to its original seems logical as presented above since the citizens are acting in their own best interests and want to protech their safety. However, before any final decisions are made about the reduction in speed limit, the citizens and officials of Forestville should evaluate all possible alternatives and causes for the increased number of accidents over the six-month period as compared to Elmsford.(提出逻辑错误，并提出建议，官方文档：what change in the argument would make the reasoning more sound.)

2. 范文2：
    1. 原文：
        * The following appeared as a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.

        * "Five years ago, we residents of Morganton voted to keep the publicly owned pieve of land known as Scott Woods in a natural, undeveloped state. Our thinking was that, if no shopping centers or house were built there, Scott Woods would continue to benefit our community as a natural parkland. But now that our town planning committee wants to purchase the land and built a school there, we should reconsider this issue. If the land becomes a school site, no shopping centers or houses can built there, and substantial acreage(面积) would probably be devoted to athletic fields. There would be no better use of land in our community than this, since a large majority of our children particiapte in sports, and Scott Woods would contiinue to benefit our community as natural parkland."
    2. 论据：
        * Five years ago, we residents of Morganton voted to keep the publicly owned piece of land known as Scott Woods in a natural, undeveloped state
        * If no shopping centers or houses were built there, Scott Woods would continue to benefit our community as a natural parkland
        * If the land becomes a school site, no shopping centers or houses can be built there, and substantial acreage(面积) would probably be devoted to athletic fields
        * a large majority of our children participate in sports
    3. 结论：
        * Scott Woods would continue to benefit our community as natural parkland
    4. 分析：
        * 从论据1，2到论据3推理本身就可以质疑，既然5年前决定不开发，那么必须有充足理由确定现在的情况发送改变，否则，不能说现在就必须reconsider this issue
        * 论据3的本身推理就有错误，没有证据表明学校建成了就no shopping center or houses can be built there, 剩余的能够兴建体育场的面积完全能够保证建立起shopping centers and houses. 相反，也许是学校内的建成促进了购物和住房的发展（许多家庭为了孩子上学会在附近租房子，刺激两者发展）同时，我们是否有足够的经费建立体育场也是一个疑问
        * a large majority of our children participate in sports不能说明大家参加的运动必须在田径场上进行，也就是说田径场不能适合所有孩子的需要，同样，相对park，school也不是适合所有市民的需要.
    5. 范文：
        * The letter to the editor begins by stating the reasons the residents of Morganton voted to keep Scott Woods in an undeveloped state. The letter states that the entire community could benefit from an undeveloped parkland. The residents of the town wanted to ensure that no shopping centers or houses would be built there. This, in turn, would provide everyone in the community with a valuable resource, a natural park.
        * The letter then continues by addressing the issue of building a school on the land. The author reasons that this would also benefit the entire community as a natural parkland since much of the land would be devoted to athletic fields. The author of the letter comes to the conclusion that building a school on the land would be the best thing for everyone in the community.(开头复述原文)

        * This letter is a one-sided argument about the best use of the land known as Scott Woods. The author may be a parent whose child would benefit from a new school,(学生家长方面) a teacher who thinks a school would boost the community(教师方面), or just a resident of Morganton(中立方面) Regardless of who the author is, there are many aspects of this plan that he or she has overlooked or chose to ignore.(作者通过质疑其利益涉及面，以攻击其客观性)

        * Using a piece of land to build a school is not the same thing as using it for a natural parkland.(先提出作者问题在哪) While all the members of the community could potentially benefit from a parkland, only a percentage of the population would realistically benefit from a new school.(两者区别) The author fails to recognize people like the senior citizens of community. What interest do they have in a new school? It only means higher taxes for them to pay. They will likely never to and utilize the school for anything. On the other hand, anyone can go to a park and enjoy the natural beauty and peacefulness. The use of the land for a school would destroy the benefit of a park for everyone. In turn, it would supply a school only to groups of people inexactly the right age range, not too young or too old, to reap the benefits.(本段质疑核心问题，只有少部分人受益)

        * Another point(自然过渡) the author stresses is that the use of the land for things like athletic fields somehow rationalizes the destruction of the park. What about children who don't play sports? Without the school, they could enjoy the land for anything. A playing field is a playing field. Children are not going to go out there unless they are into sports. There are many children in schools who are not interested in or are not able to play sports. This is yet another group who will be left out of the grand benefits of a school that the author talks about.(指出park和运动场的区别，表明运动场并非好事)

        * The author's conclusion that "there would be no better use of land in our community than this.." is easily arguable. THe destruction of Scott Woods for the purpose of building a school would not only affect the ambience of Morganton, it would affect who would and would not be able to utilize the space. If the residents as a whole voted to keep Scott Woods in an undeveloped state, this argument will not sway their decision. The use of the land for a school will probably benefit even less people than a shopping center would. The whole purpose of the vote was to keep the land as an asset for everyone. THe only way to do this is to keep it in an undeveloped state. Using the land for school does not accomplish this.(总结，同样的意思却不重复说法，这总结是全文经典)
