1. 范文一:

    1. 原文：  
        * *Six months ago the region of Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the region's highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change took effect, the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent. But the speed limit in Elmsford, a region neghboring Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined sloghtly during the same six-month period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what it was before the increase.*

    2. 论据：
        * Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles by ten miles per hour
        * the number of automobile accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent
        * the speed limit in Elmsford remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined slightly during the same six-month period
    
    3. 结论：
        * If the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of automobile accidents on the region's highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville's speed limit to what before the increase.
    
    4. 分析：
        * 论据1，2建立因果，可以攻击时序性因果错误，找出他因，削弱论据1，2间因果联系
        * 论据3和论据1，2之间是类比关系，错误类比
        * 是否忽略其他导致交通事故的原因，是否limit speed就减少交通事故
    
    5. 范文：
        * The argument is well-presented,but not thoroughly well-reasoned. By making a comparison of the region of Forestville, the town with the higher speed limit and therefore aitomobile accidents, with the region of Elmsford, an area of a lower speed limit and subsequently fewer accidents, the argumet for reducing Forestville's speed limits in order to decrease accidents seems logical.(用seem表不合理)
        
        However, the citizens of Forestville are failing to consider other possible alternatives to the increasing car accidents after the raise in speed limit. Such alternatives may include the fact that there are less reliable cars traveling the roads in Forestville,(车况不同) or that the age bracket of theose in Elmsford may be more conducive to drving safely.(驾驶者本算因素). It is possible that there are more younger, inexperienced, or more elderly, unsafe drivers in Forestville than there are in Elmsford. In addition, the citizens have failed to consider the geographical and physical terrain of the two different areas.(道路状况不同) Perhaps Forestville's highway is in an area of more dangerous curves, sharp turns, or has many intersections or merging points where accidents are more likely to occur. It appears reasonable, therefore, for the citizens to focus on these trouble spots than to reduce the speed in the entire area. Elmsford may be an area of easier driving conditions where accidents are less likely to occur regardless of the speed limit.(先攻击类比问题)

        A six-month period is not a paricular longtime frame for the citizens to determine that speed limit has influenced the number of automobile accidents in the area.(时间不够长也不能下结论，削弱因果) It is mentioned in the argument that Elmsford accidents decreased during the time period. This may have been a time, such as during harsh weather conditons,(驾驶情况) when less people were driving on the road and therefore the number of accidents decreased. However, Forestville citizens, perhaps coerced by employment or other requirements, were unable to avoid driving on the roads. Again, the demographics of the population are important.(人口基数问题) It is possible that Elmsford citizens do not have to travel fa from work or work from their home, or do not work at all. Are there more people in Forestville than there were six months ago? If so, there may be an increased number of accidents due to more automobiles on the road,(把人口和事故联系，削弱速度和事故联系) and not due to the increased speed limits. Also in reference to the activities of the population, it is possible that Forestville inhabitants were traveling during less safe times of the day,(驾驶时间) such as early in the morning, or during twilight. Work or family habits may have encouraged citizens to drive during this time when Elmsford residents may not have been forced to do so.(批驳忽略他因的错误，官方说明：identifying a central flaw in the argument and developing that critique extensively)

        Overall, the reasoning behind decreasing Forestville's speed limit back to its original seems logical as presented above since the citizens are acting in their own best interests and want to protech their safety. However, before any final decisions are made about the reduction in speed limit, the citizens and officials of Forestville should evaluate all possible alternatives and causes for the increased number of accidents over the six-month period as compared to Elmsford.(提出逻辑错误，并提出建议，官方文档：what change in the argument would make the reasoning more sound.)
